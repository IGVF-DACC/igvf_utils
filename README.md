Bug fixes in Master:

1. Fixed bug reported by Jennifer Jou where the `profile.Profile._set_profile_id()` method didn't properly singularize the profile ID in all cases. Fixed this by using the inflection module's singularize function.
2. Fixed bug where `eu_register.py`'s `typecase()` function didn't check for booleans to typecaset to.  Thanks again to jjou for reporting.

These fixes will be rolled out in the next (minor) release.
