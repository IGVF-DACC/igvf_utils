# Installation on Terra platfrom

Create a new workspace and link it to a proper billing account. On the workspace UI, click on a cloud-shaped icon on the right sidebar and create a new Jupyter notebook terminal.

Run the followings to install this tool and its dependencies.
```bash
pip install igvf_utils
```

This tool will automatically grab workspace name and billing project name from environment variables `WORKSPACE_NAME` and `WORKSPACE_NAMESPACE`, respectively. These environment variables are automatically set by default on Terra's Jupyter notebook instance. You can directly edit these variables to change them.

```bash
./iu_register.py ... --terra-table TERRA_TABLE_NAME
```

You can also export Terra workspace's table to a TSV file.
```bash
./iu_get_terra_table.py -t TERRA_TABLE_NAME -o out.tsv
```
