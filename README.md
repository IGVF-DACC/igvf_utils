# encode_utils
Tools that are useful to any ENCODE submitting group. Library and scripts are coded in Python. 

# Installation and Setup
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/StanfordBioinformatics/encode_utils/releases), and unpack it, which will result in a folder called encode_utils-$release, where $release is the release number. 

You'll need to set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to include the path to the top-level folder. It is also recommended to set your PATH environment variable to include the "scripts" subdirectory of the release folder.
